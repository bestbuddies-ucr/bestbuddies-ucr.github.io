        Best Buddies is an international, nonprofit organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates the opportunity for one-to-one friendships to form and flourish. Our mission is to give rise to inclusivity for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). As Best Buddies at UC Riverside, we work with Project TEAM, a vocational school for young adults with disabilities in Riverside Unified School District. Together we form life-time friendships, leadership development and wonderful memories!
